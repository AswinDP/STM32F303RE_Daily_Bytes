Hands-on bare-metal programming journey with STM32F303 â€” exploring registers, peripherals, and embedded fundamentals from scratch.

# STM32F303 Bare-Metal Learning Journey

This repository documents my personal exploration of **bare-metal embedded programming** on the **STM32F303** microcontroller.  
Instead of relying on HAL or CubeMX, all programs here are written **directly using register-level access**, referencing the **STM32F3 Reference Manual**, **Datasheet**, and **Programming Manual**.

## ðŸ§­ Goal
To gain a deep, practical understanding of how microcontroller peripherals work internally â€” from GPIO toggling to advanced modules like timers, ADCs, communication interfaces, and interrupts.
